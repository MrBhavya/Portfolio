## Overview

Development of LeapQuest, a 2D platformer game. Built using Unity for game mechanics and level construction, Aseprite and Photoshop for 2D art and animation, and C# for scripting gameplay logic. The project focused on delivering immersive gameplay through thematic level design, dynamic mechanics, and cohesive art direction.

## Key Features

- **Tilemap-Based Level Design**: Created modular Winter and Forest maps using Unity’s Tilemap system, enabling efficient terrain construction with collision properties and layered visual depth.
- **2D Sprite Animation**: Used Unity Animator Controllers for smooth transitions and expressive movement.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Implemented interactive systems like patrolling enemies, physics-based traps, and precise collision detection using C# and Unity’s physics engine to ensure responsive, challenging gameplay.
- **Audio Integration**: Used Unity’s audio tools to add environmental ambience and reactive sound effects, enhancing immersion and feedback.
- **UI/UX Design**: Developed an accessible UI with Unity’s UI tools, including menus, HUD, and interactive sound effects. Styled elements to match the game’s visual themes for a seamless user experience.
- **Level Progression System**: Designed two distinct levels with increasing difficulty and strategic challenge, encouraging skill development and replayability.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: For game engine features including Tilemap, UI, Animator, and physics systems.
- **C#**: Primary scripting language for implementing core game mechanics and logic.
- **Aseprite**: For pixel-perfect sprite creation.
- **Photoshop**: For UI elements, textures, and concept art.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was coordinating sprite animation and gameplay logic to achieve fluid and reactive character movement. Creating layered tilemaps that maintained both visual richness and efficient collision detection required iterative testing. Additionally, synchronizing team workflows using Git, Slack, and Unity versioning was essential to maintain project stability. These challenges led to a deeper understanding of both technical pipelines and collaborative game development.


## Outcome

LeapQuest was successfully developed as a complete 2D platformer featuring custom art, functional gameplay, and polished design. The project served as a hands-on opportunity to apply and integrate industry-standard tools, resulting in a deeper grasp of game design principles and development workflows. It stands as a strong portfolio piece and a foundation for future game development endeavors.
