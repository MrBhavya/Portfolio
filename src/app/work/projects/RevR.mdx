## Overview

Development of RevR, a culturally immersive 3D racing game set in a Delhi-inspired environment, using Unity and C#. The project aims to differentiate itself from generic Western racing games by providing an authentic Indian experience through localized visuals, dynamic AI, weather effects, and realistic physics. RevR offers players an engaging and relatable racing experience by integrating culturally significant map design, interactive UI, and responsive gameplay mechanics.

## Key Features

- **Culturally Rich Map Design**: Designed a unique race track inspired by Delhi’s urban landscape, integrating recognizable landmarks like metro stations and street vendors for an immersive environment.
- **Realistic Vehicle Physics**: Implemented accurate handling, acceleration, collision, and terrain-based behavior using Unity’s rigidbodies and wheel colliders to simulate real-world vehicle dynamics over jumps, ramps, and varied terrain.
- **Interactive UI and HUD**: Built an intuitive interface with menus, HUD for speed, position, lap count, and race time, providing essential information in a clear and non-intrusive layout.
- **Dynamic Environmental Effects**: Added weather , impacting visibility and, enhancing realism and gameplay diversity.
- **Sound and Visual Immersion**: Integrated responsive engine sounds, ambient effects, and culturally themed background music. Used dynamic lighting, shaders, and high-quality textures for a visually engaging experience.
- **Finish Screen and Replay Options**: After each race, players are shown their results with options to retry or return to the main menu, encouraging skill-building and replayability.
- **Adaptive AI Opponents**: Developed AI racers using a waypoint system and NavMesh pathfinding, capable of overtaking, reacting to player behavior, and handling complex track segments to ensure competitive gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Main engine for game development, physics simulation, and real-time rendering.
- **C#**: Scripting language used to implement gameplay logic, AI behaviors, and UI systems.
- **Audacity**: For audio recording, editing, and mixing background music and sound effects.
- **Photoshop**: For UI elements, textures, and concept art.
- **Blender**: For modeling and editing 3D assets like vehicles and structures.
- **Photoshop**: For UI elements, textures, and concept art.

## Challenges and Learnings

Creating a culturally grounded racing experience required balancing realism with gameplay. Modeling Delhi’s urban environment without relying on stereotypes was a key challenge, as was ensuring realistic vehicle behavior over dynamic terrain. Integrating weather effects that impact physics and designing AI with believable racing strategies also demanded significant iteration. Collaborative version control and modular asset pipelines using Git and Unity prefabs helped maintain project stability and team productivity.

## Outcome

RevR successfully delivers a fast-paced, culturally immersive racing experience, integrating responsive mechanics, intelligent AI, and visually rich environments. The game stands out for its localized setting, polished UI/UX, and realistic handling laying a strong foundation for future expansions like multiplayer modes, mini-maps, and free roam. The project highlights the potential of blending cultural specificity with core racing gameplay to redefine engagement in the racing genre.
