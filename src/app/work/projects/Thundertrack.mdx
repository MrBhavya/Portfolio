publishedAt: "2024-04-08"
summary: "ThunderTrack Rally is a 3D car simulator game developed using Unity and C#. Designed during a summer training period, the project merges classic car simulation charm with modern game development techniques. The objective is to create a visually rich and interactive driving experience for players using real-time physics, immersive terrains, and dynamic UI. Inspired by racing titles like Gran Turismo and Forza, the game offers both freeroam and racing modes, focusing on intuitive control and a rewarding user experience."

## Overview

Development of LeapQuest, a 2D platformer game. Built using Unity for game mechanics and level construction, Aseprite and Photoshop for 2D art and animation, and C# for scripting gameplay logic. The project focused on delivering immersive gameplay through thematic level design, dynamic mechanics, and cohesive art direction.

## Key Features

- **Immersive 3D Environments: Developed realistic terrains using Unity’s Terrain Tools, including cityscapes and off-road settings with textures, foliage, and lighting for visual depth.
- **Realistic Driving Mechanics: C# scripts manage car handling, acceleration, collision detection, and physics, providing authentic control dynamics across race tracks and open exploration.
- **Freeroam & Race Modes: Offers two gameplay modes tailored for exploration or competitive driving experiences, allowing players to enjoy both relaxed and goal-oriented play.
- **Game Data with ScriptableObjects: Vehicle and environment data are modularly handled through Unity’s ScriptableObject system, ensuring flexible game state management and scalability.
- **Dynamic UI System: Designed a responsive interface using Unity’s built-in UI system and TextMeshPro for menus, HUD (speed, score, game states), and in-game interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Main engine for gameplay development, physics, and animation.
- **C#**: Scripting language for implementing vehicle mechanics, UI logic, and interaction.
- **Audacity**: For audio recording, editing, and mixing background music and sound effects.
- **Photoshop**: For UI elements, textures, and concept art.
- **Blender**: For modeling and editing 3D assets like vehicles and structures.
- **Photoshop**: For UI elements, textures, and concept art.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was achieving believable vehicle physics and terrain interaction without overloading system resources. Balancing visual fidelity with performance taught valuable optimization strategies in Unity. The absence of AI or weather dynamics was noted as a limitation, but helped maintain a tight focus on core mechanics. Iterative prototyping, user testing, and UI design practices sharpened both technical and design skills, while working independently honed resource management and modular development discipline.

## Outcome

ThunderTrack Rally delivers a fully functional 3D car simulation experience with realistic physics, visually engaging environments, and responsive gameplay. It showcases the developer’s capabilities in Unity scripting, UI design, asset integration, and gameplay balancing. While current features include single-player exploration and racing, the solid framework lays the groundwork for future expansion into AI opponents, multiplayer, and dynamic world systems.
